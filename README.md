# VaultMate for Obsidian

VaultMate is a personal companion plugin for Obsidian, and the in-Obsidian half of the VaultMate Android app. It shares the app's pixel-art, Japanese-inspired look.

> **Status:** early development (0.1.0). The decision and prediction journal is available. The other features below are planned.

## Decision journal

Write a decision or a prediction anywhere in a note as a task-style line, such as `- [ ] Move to Lyon #decision [confidence:: 70%] ➕ 2026-10-08 📅 2027-01-08`. The due date is the review date, so the Tasks plugin and the VaultMate app show it on the right day. The tag names can be changed in the settings; the journal can be turned off there.

- **Capture:** type `#decision` (or `#prediction`) and a space at the end of a line, or start a line with `Decision:` (also `Décision :`, `Prediction:`, `Prédiction :`), and pick a review date. The commands **New decision**, **New prediction**, **Track this line as a decision** and **Track this line as a prediction** open a short form. They work on mobile; add them to the mobile toolbar in the Obsidian settings.
- **Badge:** a small label at the end of each decision or prediction line shows its state (for example "Decision · review in 3 months" or "Decision · 3 days overdue"). Click it to review the entry, or to track a line. Live Preview and source mode only; reading view shows no badge.
- **Review:** the **Review this line** command, the badge or the panel opens a form that shows what you wrote and expected. Close the entry with its outcome, or review again later. The review is written as a `Review <date>: …` sub-item under the line.
- **Panel:** the Reviews section lists open entries as overdue, this week, upcoming, or without a review date. A notice tells you once a day when reviews are due.

## Planned features

- **Challenge questions:** on request, an AI provider you configure reads the current note and returns a few open questions that challenge it. VaultMate shows questions only, never generated prose.
- **Location:** add `latitude`, `longitude` and a place label to a note's properties by searching OpenStreetMap. On Android, the optional VaultMate app can supply the current position, because Obsidian has no access to device location.
- **Collection recommendations:** on request, an AI provider suggests titles from a taste profile built from your own ratings.
- **Context finder:** see which notes are worth reading next to the active note, and why each one was picked. Computed locally.

AI features run only when you ask for them, with the provider, model and prompts you choose.

## Working with the VaultMate Android app

The plugin and the app share data only through Markdown notes and properties in your vault. Review reminders are [Tasks](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/)-style lines with a due date, so the app's task widgets show them on the right day.

## Privacy

The plugin collects no telemetry and makes no network requests. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## Support

If VaultMate is useful to you, you can support its development through [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/gibbonolive9442).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The repository is meant to live in a development vault's `.obsidian/plugins/vaultmate` folder; with the [Hot Reload](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) plugin, Obsidian reloads VaultMate after each rebuild.

Checks, in CI order: `npm run check`, `npm run lint` (Obsidian's review rules), `npm test`, `npm run build`.

Sprites are drawn in the VaultMate Android project (`tools/sprites`). Copy a new sprite once into `assets/sprites/`, then refresh all of them with `npm run sync-sprites -- <path to the Android project>`.

## Releases

The release workflow runs when you push a Git tag. Before tagging, update `manifest.json` and `versions.json`, commit the version change, and verify the checks above. The tag must exactly match `manifest.json` (for example, `0.1.0`, not `v0.1.0`). The workflow creates a GitHub release with `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` attached.
